# Detecting Age with Static Images

Created 9 June 2020

The purpose of this package is to identify age through
static images. Following some four repositories later
and not knowing much machine learning techniques (only
concepts), I decided to use Haar Cascades to better
accomodate for future plans of live calls in addition
to some other models in order to deal with dropped FPS.

For now, this is all about static images, finding out
how many images are needed to get an average accurate
prediction rate of 90% and finding ways to improve
the rate while decreasing the number of images needed
for proper identification.

Note: when speaking of utilizing multiple images, it's
to increase accuracy by getting more features at different
angles and curves in case that's the reason.
